SPEED CARD GAME

Welcome to possibly one of the hardest (to code) card games to play on the HSA Console!

Difficulties:

Easy - Computer waits for 7 seconds before playing
Medium - Computer waits for 5 seconds before playing
Hard - Computer waits for 3 seconds before playing
Impossible - Computer waits for 1 second before playing

Rounds:

You get an option to choose how many rounds you want there to be played (1 - 10)
after the # of rounds inputted are finished then a winner is chosen based
how many points each user (player and computer) have

Input a number 1 - 4 to select your difficulty (1 being easiest and 4 being hardest)

Table Cards:
Value 1, Value 2

In this case you have to input a card that is 1 more or 1 less than either one of the table cards


Cards:
    Card Value : # of the card in your hands

Card value represents value of the card (1 - 13)
# of card in your hands represents how many of those cards you have in your hand (1 - 4) 

Example scenario

Table Card:
5, 3

2 : 1
8 : 2
6 : 1
1 : 1

Here you have 1 of card 2, 2 of card 8, 1 of card 6, 1 of card 1

You would input the value of the card you want to play

Example: 

6

This will return if your choice is correct / valid or not and check with the computer if the computer has responded
and declare winner accordingly

In case none of your cards are applicable in a scenario
Input: 0 to tie the game
