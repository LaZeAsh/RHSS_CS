- Points awarded (fix that point isnt being added)
- Declare clear winner in text

Level 2:
Must do (Level 2 Features):
- Player vs Computer format. (done)
- A game must consist of a user defined multiple (max 10) rounds of play. (done)
- The result of each round must be presented on the HSA console and game play must pause. (done)
- The player and computer points awarded as follows 2 points are given to the winning player, 0 points
to the losing player and 1 point to each for a tie. (done)
- A player must be able to end the game they are playing. (done)
- When a game ends the game stats of each player should be shown and the winner of the game
should be declared. (done)
- All input and output must use the HSA Console. (done)

Level 3:
Level 3 Features
- A player must be able to start a new game after finishing a game. (done)
- The results of each round and the final game result is written to an Output.txt file. (done)
- The details of each round of play are stored in an array. (done)

Level 4:
Level 4 Features
- The game stats & winner declaration must be processed and displayed using a command method 
called outputResults() that uses the information stored in the array that stores the points from
each round played. (done)
- Complex game algorithm involving nested if statements. (done)

Level 4+:
Level 4 + Features
- Implementation of a highly complex Game algorithm. Confirm with your Teacher if the planned game
algorithm meets this requirement. A complex game algorithm must include use of multi-nested
selection and/or repetition to determine the computer round move and the round winner. A game
algorithm like Rock Paper Scissors would not be considered complex. (done)
- In addition to excellent implementation of the previous stated features, to achieve a Level 4+, the
programmers should provide additional game feature(s) (stated in your project plan) to achieve this
level. (done)
